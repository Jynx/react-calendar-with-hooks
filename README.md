This was built as a small hooks demo when hooks were near alpha.

TODO:

- Actually get the custom useReducer hook functioning. 
- Remove/add dependencies from dependency arrays now that I actually understand how they work at a much deeper level. This app is riddled with incorrect dependency arrays.
